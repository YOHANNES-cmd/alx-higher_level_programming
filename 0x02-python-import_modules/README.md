# 0x02. Python - import & modules

## Tasks

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file
Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b
and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
Your program should print: <a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value> followed with a new line
You can only use the word add_0 once in your code
You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported - by using __import__.
